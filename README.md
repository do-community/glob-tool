# Glob Tool

A tool to test globs against sets of test strings quickly and easily for the DigitalOcean Community.

---

## Development/Building

To setup the build/develop environment, you will need to run `npm i` with Node 12+ installed. This will install the
 dependencies to allow you to build the project.

To develop for this tool run `npm run dev`.
This will start a development server that will automatically reload the codebase when changes occur.

If you wish to host this tool on a service, simply run `npm run build`. This will run all the necessary build scripts
 automatically to build the tool.\
You can then take the `dist` folder and put it on your web server/bucket.

GitHub Actions is setup to do this automatically for this repository to deploy to gh-pages.

## Source Structure

### [`src/glob-tool`](./src/glob-tool)

#### [`src/glob-tool/i18n`](./src/glob-tool/i18n)

In this directory lives all the internationalisation data and strings for the tool.
Currently, this only contains the English versions of the strings but could be expanded in the future.

#### [`src/glob-tool/scss`](./src/glob-tool/scss)

The scss directory contains the main SCSS styling file for the tool, which imports our do-bulma library and then adds
 tool-specific customisations.

#### [`src/glob-tool/templates`](./src/glob-tool/templates)

This directory contains the Vue templates that are used to render the tool on the client-side.
`app.vue` is the main Vue file that other templates are referenced into.
